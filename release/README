# Release Scripts

The various release scripts are present in this directory. They are mostly
meant to be reusable in standalone fashion, with as little logical input
and interdependency as possible.

Some notable scripts:

 * release-source: Builds a tarball and patches from a git repository
 * release-srpm: Builds a source rpm from a tarball, patches and spec file

The scripts can be run by the release-runner script in such a way that
they all prepare their steps, and then commit them after everything has
been prepared.

# Cockpit Release Runner

This is the container for the Cockpit release runner.

## How to deploy

First get the container:

    # docker pull cockpit/infra-release

Setup a 'cockpit' user:

    # groupadd -g 1111 -r cockpit && useradd -r -g cockpit -u 1111 cockpit
    # mkdir -p /home/cockpit/.ssh /home/cockpit/.config /home/cockpit/release
    # chown cockpit:cockpit /home/cockpit

Fill in the following files with valid credentials able to post logs to sink and
update github status:

    /home/cockpit/.ssh/id_rsa
    /home/cockpit/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    /home/cockpit/.ssh/known_hosts
    /home/cockpit/.config/bodhi-user
    /home/cockpit/.config/copr
    /home/cockpit/.config/github-token
    /home/cockpit/.config/github-whitelist
    /home/cockpit/.fedora-password
    /home/cockpit/.fedora.cert
    /home/cockpit/.fedora-server-ca.cert
    /home/cockpit/.gitconfig
    /home/cockpit/.gnupg

Get the service file. Edit it before installing it. Set the TEST_OS.
Then install it and run it:

    # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockpit-project/cockpituous/master/release/cockpit-release.service
    # cp cockpit-release.service /etc/systemd/system/
    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable cockpit-release
    # systemctl start cockpit-release

# Troubleshooting

Some helpful commands:

    # journalctl -fu cockpit-release
    # systemctl stop cockpit-release

# Updates

To update, just pull the new container and restart the cockpit-verify service.
It will restart automatically when it finds a pause in the verification work.

    # docker pull cockpit/infra-release
    # systemctl restart cockpit-release
