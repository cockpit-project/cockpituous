# Cockpit Release Runner

This is the container for the Cockpit release runner.

## How to deploy

First get the container:

    # docker pull cockpit/infra-release

Setup a 'cockpit' user:

    # groupadd -g 1111 -r cockpit && useradd -r -g cockpit -u 1111 cockpit
    # mkdir -p /home/cockpit/.ssh /home/cockpit/.config /home/cockpit/release
    # chown cockpit:cockpit /home/cockpit

Fill in the following files with valid credentials able to post logs to sink and
update github status:

    /home/cockpit/.ssh/id_rsa
    /home/cockpit/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    /home/cockpit/.ssh/known_hosts
    /home/cockpit/.config/bodhi-user
    /home/cockpit/.config/bodhi-password
    /home/cockpit/.config/copr
    /home/cockpit/.config/github-token
    /home/cockpit/.config/github-whitelist
    /home/cockpit/.fedora.cert
    /home/cockpit/.fedora-server-ca.cert
    /home/cockpit/.gitconfig

Get the service file. Edit it before installing it. Set the TEST_OS.
Then install it and run it:

    # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockpit-project/cockpituous/master/release/cockpit-release.service
    # cp cockpit-release.service /etc/systemd/system/
    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable cockpit-release
    # systemctl start cockpit-release

# Troubleshooting

Some helpful commands:

    # journalctl -fu cockpit-release
    # systemctl stop cockpit-release

# Updates

To update, just pull the new container and restart the cockpit-verify service.
It will restart automatically when it finds a pause in the verification work.

    # docker pull cockpit/infra-release
    # systemctl restart cockpit-release
