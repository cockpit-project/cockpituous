# Cockpit Continuous Integration

This is the staging container and configuration for the Cockpit
integration tests. This documentation is for deployment on Fedora 22+
or RHEL 7+.

Use the following commands to run the tasks container as a one off:

    $ sudo yum -y install docker atomic oci-kvm-hook
    $ sudo systemctl start docker
    $ sudo atomic run cockpit/tasks

You can run the tests in the resulting container shell like this.
Or see tests/HACKING in the cockpit repo for more info.

   $ test/verify/run-tests --install

The container has optional mounts:

 * ```/secrets```: A directory containing at least the following files
   * ```ssh-config```: SSH configuration file containing a 'sink' host
   * ```github-token```: A file containing a GitHub token to post results
   * ```image-stores```: Non default locations to try downloading images from
   * ```rhel-login```: Red Hat subscription credential login (optional)
   * ```rhel-password```: Red Hat subscription credential password (optional)
 * ```/cache```: A directory for reusable cached data such as downloaded image files

The mounts normally default to ```/var/lib/cockpit-tasks/secrets``` and
```/var/cache/cockpit-tasks``` on the host.

# Deploying on a host

For testing machines that publish back results create a file called
```/var/lib/cockpit-tasks/secrets/ssh-config``` as follows, and place ```id_rsa```
```id_rsa.pub``` ```authorized_keys``` and a ```github-token``` in the same directory.

    UserKnownHostsFile /secrets/authorized_keys
    Host sink
        HostName fedorapeople.org
        IdentityFile /secrets/id_rsa
        User cockpit

To transfer secrets from one host to another, you would do something like:

    $ SRC=user@source.example.com
    $ DEST=user@source.example.com
    $ ssh $SRC sudo tar -czf - /var/lib/cockpit-tasks/secrets/ | ssh $DEST sudo tar -C / -xzvf -

Make sure docker and atomic are installed and running:

    $ sudo systemctl enable docker
    $ sudo atomic install cockpit/tasks

You may want to customize things like the operating system to test or number of jobs:

    $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/cockpit-tasks.service.d
    $ sudo sh -c 'printf "[Service]\nEnvironment=TEST_JOBS=8\n" > /etc/systemd/system/cockpit-tasks.service.d/jobs.conf'
    $ sudo sh -c 'printf "[Service]\nEnvironment=TEST_CACHE=/mnt/nfs/share/cache\n" > /etc/systemd/system/cockpit-tasks.service.d/cache.conf'
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

And now you can start the service:

    $ sudo systemctl start cockpit-tasks
    $ sudo systemctl enable cockpit-tasks

## Troubleshooting

Some helpful commands:

    # journalctl -fu cockpit-tasks
    # systemctl stop cockpit-tasks

## Updates

To update, just pull the new container and restart the cockpit-tasks service.
It will restart automatically when it finds a pause in the verification work.

    # docker pull cockpit/tasks

## Deploying on Openshift

The testing machines can run on Openshift cluster(s).

Create a service account for use by the testing machines. Make sure to have the
```oci-kvm-hook``` package installed on all nodes.  This is because of the requirement
to access ```/dev/kvm```. Further work is necessary to remove this requirement.

    $ oc create -f tasks/cockpituous-account.json
    $ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z cockpituous
    $ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user hostmount-anyuid -z cockpituous

Now create all the remaining kubernetes objects. The secrets are created from the
```/var/lib/cockpit-tasks/secrets``` directory as described above.

    $ sudo make tasks-secrets | oc create -f -
    $ oc create -f tasks/cockpit-tasks.json

## Troubleshooting

Some helpful commands:

    $ oc describe rc
    $ oc describe pods
    $ oc log -f cockpit-tasks-xxxx

The tests need ```/dev/kvm``` to be accessible to non-root users on each node:

    $ sudo modprobe kvm
    $ printf 'kvm\n' | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/kvm.conf
    $ sudo chmod 666 /dev/kvm
    $ printf 'KERNEL=="kvm", GROUP="kvm", MODE="0666"\n' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/80-kvm.rules

Some of the older tests need ip6_tables to be loaded:

    $ sudo modprobe ip6_tables
    $ printf 'ip6_tables\n' | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/ip6_tables.conf

Some tests need nested virtualization enabled:

    $ sudo -s
    # echo "options kvm-intel nested=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf
    # echo "options kvm-amd nested=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-amd.conf
    # ( rmmod kvm-intel && modprobe kvm-intel ) || ( rmmod kvm-amd && modprobe kvm-amd )

SELinux needs to know about the caching directories:

    # chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /var/cache/cockpit-tasks/

Service affinity currently wants all the cockpit-tasks pods to be in the same region.
If you have your own cluster make sure all the nodes are in the same region:

    $ oc patch node node.example.com -p '{"metadata":{"labels": {"region": "infra"}}}'

## Scaling

We can scale the number of testing machines in the openshift cluster with this
command:

    $ oc scale rc cockpit-tasks --replicas=3
