# Cockpit Integration Test

This is the deployment container and configuration for the Cockpit
integration tests. This documentation is for deployment on Fedora 22+
or RHEL 7+

This is for a single operating system. Choose the operating system to
test ahead of time.

## How to deploy

First get the container:

    # docker pull cockpit/infra-verify

Some bits need to be configured outside the container:

    # yum install libvirt libvirt-client qemu-system-x86
    # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/master/test/vm-prep
    # sh vm-prep

Setup a 'cockpit' user:

    # groupadd -g 1111 -r cockpit && useradd -r -g cockpit -u 1111 cockpit
    # mkdir -p /home/cockpit/.ssh /home/cockpit/.config
    # chown -R cockpit:cockpit /home/cockpit

Fill in the following files with valid credentials able to post logs to sink and
update github status:

    /home/cockpit/.ssh/id_rsa
    /home/cockpit/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    /home/cockpit/.config/github-token
    /home/cockpit/.config/github-whitelist

Put the following into /home/cockpit/.ssh/config:

    Host fedorapeople.org
        User cockpit

Get the service file. Edit it before installing it. Set the TEST_OS.
Then install it and run it:

    # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockpit-project/cockpituous/master/verify/cockpit-verify.service
    # cp cockpit-verify.service /etc/systemd/system/
    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable cockpit-verify
    # systemctl start cockpit-verify

# Troubleshooting

Some helpful commands:

    # journalctl -fu cockpit-verify
    # systemctl stop cockpit-verify

# Updates

To update, just pull the new container and restart the cockpit-verify service.
It will restart automatically when it finds a pause in the verification work.

    # docker pull cockpit/infra-verify
